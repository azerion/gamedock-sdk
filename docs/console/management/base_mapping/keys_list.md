# Mapping

Page is used to handle the NAM part of the SLOT. Native app management is a functionality used by finance team to define/import the data from sales force into SLOT and then processed by BI reporting team to create reports based on the data.

On this page we define all the keys that will be mapped from salesforce. You can modify existing ones but also add new keys that will be available for mapping.

On the second tab (auto imports) you can define auto importing of the data from the salesforce instead of fetching the data manually.
