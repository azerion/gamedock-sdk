# Testrail Config
This page contains the configuration that is needed to connect to testrail, with which we can store what we configure in the **testrail** tab. To get this set up please contact the gamedock team. Next to that we can create **abstracts**. Abstracts are constant values which can be used in the testail tests. For example a package_id that is used in multiple tests can be configured as an abstract.
